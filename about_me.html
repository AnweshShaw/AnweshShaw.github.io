                    Hi,I am Anwesh Shaw. I am 19 years old and pursuing my Bachelors in CSE at SRMIST Chennai.

                    I adore programming and love taking on new challenges. My deep love for coding and interest in new technologies
                    led me to choose CSE as my field of study and career.

                <h3>
                    I am proficient in C, C++, and Python. I have worked with many Python libraries and applied this knowledge to make
                    projects and am still exploring new libraries.
                    I am a Front-End Web-Developer. I know how to deploy Django and Flask frameworks.
                    Currently, I am learning backend Web-Development and aim to be a Full Stack Web-Developer.
                    I also have a basic knowledge of Java. I have worked with SQL and have a basic knowledge of Linux
                    Command Line Interface(CLI).

                    In the near future, I aim to learn about Javascript and the MERN stack. 
                    I wish to explore new frameworks and the field of App Development.  
                    I am keen in gaining more knowledge and try my level best to be better everyday.
